# 8 Queens Puzzle - Competitive Game

## Overview
This project is a unique take on the classic 8 queens puzzle, often used in discussions about search algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence. In the traditional puzzle, the goal is to place eight queens on a standard chessboard in such a way that none of the queens can attack each other. The challenge lies in finding a successful layout where no queens are in each other's attack paths.

In this project, I transform this algorithmic task into an interactive two-player game, pitting you against the computer. Players take turns placing queens on the board, with some strategic limitations:

- Queens can only be placed on open tiles where no queens are attacking each other.
- If there are no available tiles for the current player to place a queen, the player who placed the last queen wins.

## Features
- **Competitive Gameplay:** Challenge your strategic thinking as you face off against the computer in a game of wits.
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** The computer opponent employs the A* algorithm to predict future moves and make intelligent decisions. It can either maximize or minimize the remaining available tiles after a move.
- **Visualized Available Moves:** Gain insights into your opponent's strategy by visualizing the available moves on the board.
- **Future Enhancements:** I have plans to make the game even more engaging by adding features like multiplayer mode or allowing players to make strategic queen movements.

## Development Journey
Creating this spin-off of the 8 queens puzzle was an exciting and educational journey. I envisioned turning a traditional computer algorithm task into a competitive and user-friendly game. The project taught me valuable lessons and required considerable effort, but I'm thrilled with the results.

I believe you'll enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed creating it. Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to your feedback!
